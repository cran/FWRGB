\title{Fresh Weight Determination from the Projected Area of the Plant}
\usage{
Biomass.Estimation(Biomass, PA, model = c("lm", "ANN", "SVM"), newPA)
}
\arguments{
\item{Biomass}{ground truth fresh biomass of the above ground plant parts for the model development}

\item{PA}{a numeric value representing projected area (in cm square) of the above ground plant parts from the visual image of the plant}

\item{model}{the applied machine learning model i.e., "lm" or, "ANN" or,"SVM"}

\item{newPA}{out of sample projected area (in cm square) of the above ground plant parts from the visual image of the plant}
}
\value{
Fresh weight in gm
}
\description{
The projected area obtained from the visual image of the plant is used as input to the machine learning model (Linear Model, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Regression) to determine the plant's fresh weight.
